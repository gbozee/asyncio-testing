# Testing asyncio code

This repository contains the examples featured in my blog article 
[Unit Testing AsyncIO Code](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/unit-testing-asyncio-code).

Note that these tests work only on Python 3.5+.

To run the unit synchronous unit tests, use the following command:

    $ python test_receive.py

To run the asynchronous unit tests, use the following command:

    $ python test_async_receive.py
